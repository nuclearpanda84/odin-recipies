		<h3> Background / Description </h3>

		<p> This recipe was shared with me by a special friend in Atlanta, GA. It has long been a favorite, and everyone who tastes it says it is the best they have ever had.
		My mother would always tell me stories of how this recipe has been passed down between our local community for generations. If you follow this recipe, you'll make enough
		to serve up to nine hungry people with warm pumpkin-y goodness.</p>

		<h3> Ingredients </h3>

		<ul> 
			<li>1 Pound of Pumpkin</li>
			<li>1/2 Cup of Butter, softened</li>
			<li>1 Cup of White Sugar</li>
			<li>1/2 Cup of Milk</li>
			<li>2 Eggs</li>
			<li>1/2 Teaspoon of Nutmeg</li>
			<li>1 Teaspoon of Vanilla</li>
			<li>1 9-Inch Unbaked Pie Crust</li>
		</ul>

		<ol>
			<li>Boil pumpkin for 40 to 50 minutes, or until done. Run cold water over the pumpkin, remove any hardened pieces and skin.</li>

			<li>Break apart pumpkin in a bowl. Add butter, and mix well with mixer. Stir in sugar, milk, eggs, nutmeg, cinnamon and vanilla.
			Beat on medium speed until mixture is smooth. Pour filling into an unbaked pie crust.</li>

			<li> Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 55 to 60 minutes, or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Pie will
			puff up like a souffle, and then will sink down as it cools.</li>
		</ol>
